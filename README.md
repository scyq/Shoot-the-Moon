# Say Hi~

Hi, I am scyq.

Many players told me that it is slow to open the game in browser. So I publish the win_64 and macOS version on itch.io for everyone.

Thank you all guys for playing it! It helps me a lot.

If there are bugs in the game, you are welcomed to issue in GitHub or comment on itch.io. It is important for me.

Thank you again and enjoy it.

Game Off 2020

**Theme:** Moonshot

**Engine:** Godot 

**Author:** @scyq

## Description

Use your wisdom to control your brick fleet and hit the moon more times.
Bricks have health, and the durability of bricks is not unlimited.
Death does not mean failure, hitting the moon is our ultimate goal.

The v1.0 version only supports person-versus-person battles and local HTML5 versions. 

P1 uses the arrow to control the direction, right Shift to reorganize the bricks. 

P2 controls the direction through WASD, and the space bar reorganizes the bricks.
